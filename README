This is a fork of the source code for the book: "Ray Tracing From the Ground Up" by Kevin Suffern.

The source code was taken from http://www.raytracegroundup.com/ and is GPL.  See License.txt for details.

I split the code into a static raytracer library and the UI application.  This is the UI application.

    CodeBlocks, a free C/C++ IDE.
    Boost, high quality C++ libraries.
    The RTFGU static library, also hosted at github.

New UI Features:
* ViewPlane takes it's width and height from the window.
* Builder functions selectable from toolbar.
